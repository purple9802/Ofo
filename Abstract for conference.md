In recent years, rare-earth-free permanent magnets have gained significant attention due to their potential for sustainable and environmentally friendly applications. MnBi magnets, with their exceptional magnetic properties, have emerged as promising candidates in this regard. However, challenges such as low coercivity and susceptibility to corrosion have hindered their widespread application. This study focuses on the development of a novel approach to enhance the coercivity of MnBi sintered magnets through polymer coating techniques.

In this research, MnBi sintered magnets were coated with a specialized polymer material using advanced fabrication methods. The effects of the polymer coating on the magnetic properties, especially coercivity, were systematically investigated. Through experimental analysis, the interaction between the polymer coating and the microstructure was explored, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the coercivity enhancement mechanism.

The results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the coercivity of polymer-coated MnBi sintered magnets, with an increase from 5669 Oe to 7891 Oe, which is approximately a 2kOe increase. However, the saturation magnetization decreased from 69.87 emu/g to 62.93 emu/g, and the remanence decreased from 63.30 emu/g to 52.32 emu/g.

Although coercivity is successfully enhanced by using polymer-coated powder, the decrease in magnetization was much higher than expected. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the experimental procedures, including the type of polymer coated and the quantity of polymer, to further improve the magnetic properties.
