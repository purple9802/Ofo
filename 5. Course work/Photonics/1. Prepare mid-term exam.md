## Introduction of semiconductor
- What is photonics?
	- Electronics controls the flow of electrons - Photonics controls the flow of photons.
	- Sometimes saying Optoelectronics = Optics + Electrons
- Semiconductor photonics
	- LED
	- Optical amplifier
	- Laser
	- Photo detector
		- p-i-n photodiodes
		- Schottky-Barrier photodiodes
- Surface plasmon subwavelength optics
	- surface plasmon 
		- collective eletron oscillations existing on metal/dielectric interfaces
		- trapped light wave on the metal surface
		- light confinement in a deep subwavelenght volume

- Photonic crystals
	- Periodic arrangement of dielectric (metallic, polaritonic...) objects.
	- Lattice constants comparable to the wavelenght of light in the material.
	- There are allowed modes and forbidden modes.
		- Forbidden modes occur in a band of frequencies called photonic band gap
	- Point defects acts as an optical cavity, trapping the radiation.
	- Line defects allow the light to propagate along the defect line.

- Indirect bandgap - direct bandgap
- Similar to electron motion in free space "near the band edge", if we introduce different mass(Effective mass)
- Basic optical processes in semiconductors
	- Absorption of a photon can create an electron-hole pair
	- Recombination of an electron and a hole can generate a photon

## Excitons
- Interband absorption creates an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band. The coulomb interaction between the them can give rise to the formation new excitations of crystal, called exctions
- This attractive interaction increases the probability of the formation of an electron-hole pair, and therefore increases the optical transition rate.
- Wannier-Mott type 
	- This excitons have a large radius that encompasses many atoms and are delocalized states that can move freely throughout the crystal.
	- This one have small biding energy (~0.01 eV) due to their large radius. So, they are observed clearly at cryogenic temperatures in typical semiconductors
- Frenkel excitons
	- This have a much smaller radius and are localized states which are tightly bound to specific atoms or molecules. They can move through the crystal by hopping from one atom site to another.
	- This one have larger binding energies of the order 0.1 ~ 1 eV and are usually stable at room temperature.
- ![[Pasted image 20231017010809.png]]
- In free excitons, the average separation of the electrons and holes is much greater than the atomic spacing. Therefore, it is a good approximation to average over detailed structure of the atoms in between the electron and hole, and consider the particles to be moving in a uniform dielectric material.
- We can model the free exciton as a hydrogenic system (such as the Bohr model)
- Free exciton behavior is the best observed in semiconductors with medium-size band gap in range 1 ~ 3 eV
- Exciton absorption
	- Excitons can only be formed if the electrons and hole group velocities Ve and Vh are the same. This is necessary condition for the electrons and holes to be able to move together as a bound pair. Ve = Vh can only be satisfied if the gradients of the conduction and valence bands are the same at the point of the point of the Brillouin zone where the transition occurs.
	- Because all bands have zero gradient at the zone center, excitons are formed during a direct transition at k = 0.
- Free excitons can only be observed in the absorption spectrum very pure samples. Because impurities release unpaired free electrons and holes that can screen Coulomb interaction in the exciton and thereby strongly reduce the binding forces.
- In the indirect band gap materials, Ve = Vh is enough but k vector is high. So It's difficult to observe excitons.
- Frenkel excitons
	- The coupling between excitons and lattice (phonon) is usually very strong. (polaron effect)
	- It's leads to 'self-trapping' effects, in which the excitons produces a local distortion of the lattice. Then, it cause further localization of the exciton wave funtions.
	1. Rare gas crystal
	2. Alkali halides
	3. Molecular crystals - organic thin film structure
		- This is a consequence of the fact that the molecular crystals are held together by relatively weak van der waals forces, so that the molecular levels are only weakly perturbed when condensing to the solid state.

## luminescence

- Electrons in an excited state can return to a lower level by emitting photons, called luminescence.
	- Photoluminescence - the re-emission of light after absorbing a photon of higher energy.
	- Electroluminescence - the emission of light caused by running an electric current through the material
- Interband luminescence
	- interband luminescence occurs in a semiconductor when an electron that has been excited into the conduction band drops back to the valence band by emission of photon, corresponding to the annihilation of an electron-hole pair
	- There are very important differences between the optical properties of direct and indirect
	- Interband luminescence process in a direct
		- the filled states at the bottom of the conduction band and the empty states at the top of the valence band are create by injecting electrons and holes into the semi conductor
		- ![[Pasted image 20231017025147.png]]
	- interband luminescence process in a indirect
		- the transition must involve the absorption or emission of a phonon to conserve momentum
