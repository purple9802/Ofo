## About mid term exam
- 문제는 총 4세트
	- Introduction에서 두세트
	- Absorption, Excitons, Luminescence에서 두세트
- ~~ 를 설명하시오 형식의 문제로만 출제가 됨
- 키포인트는 "세트"문제라는 것을 유의하면서 공부를 시작해 봅시다.

## Introduction of semiconductor
- What is photonics?
	- Electronics controls the flow of electrons - Photonics controls the flow of photons.
	- Sometimes saying Optoelectronics = Optics + Electrons
- Semiconductor photonics
	- LED
	- Optical amplifier
	- Laser
	- Photo detector
		- p-i-n photodiodes
		- Schottky-Barrier photodiodes
- Surface plasmon subwavelength optics
	- surface plasmon 
		- collective eletron oscillations existing on metal/dielectric interfaces
		- trapped light wave on the metal surface
		- light confinement in a deep subwavelenght volume

- Photonic crystals
	- Periodic arrangement of dielectric (metallic, polaritonic...) objects.
	- Lattice constants comparable to the wavelenght of light in the material.
	- There are allowed modes and forbidden modes.
		- Forbidden modes occur in a band of frequencies called photonic band gap
	- Point defects acts as an optical cavity, trapping the radiation.
	- Line defects allow the light to propagate along the defect line.

- Indirect bandgap - direct bandgap
- Similar to electron motion in free space "near the band edge", if we introduce different mass(Effective mass)
- Basic optical processes in semiconductors
	- Absorption of a photon can create an electron-hole pair
	- Recombination of an electron and a hole can generate a photon

- Heterojucntions - quantum well
	- Different semiconductor, different band gap jucntion.
	- That can np and pp
- quantum well
	- Well width can control intensity and wavelength.
- Photon interaction in quantum-confined structure
	- Interband transition
	- Excitonic transition
	- Intraband transition
	- Miniband transition in a superlattice structure.
