## Solid state sintering

- For LTP-MnBI tend to liquid phase sintering, because of the phase transform to HTP
- So, we need Bi-rich phase or the other.
- How about do solid state sintering and homogenization?

## Detailed Process 1

1. Cold compact on magnetic field
2. Heat-treatment arond 900 dgreeC 
3. Cool down until 300 dgreeC and maintaing
4. Finally cool down until RT
